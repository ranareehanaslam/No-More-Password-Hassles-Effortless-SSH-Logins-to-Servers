Setting Up Shared SSH Key Authentication for Team Access: A Simplified Guide Effortless Server Management: Streamlining Access with Shared SSH Keys for Teams


Creating a single key and sharing it among multiple users has some security implications and is generally not recommended. If the single key falls into the wrong hands or if a team member leaves, you would need to regenerate and redistribute a new key to maintain security. Also, it becomes challenging to track individual user activities as they all share the same key.

However, if you still want to proceed with a shared key approach, here's a simplified guide:

### Step 1: Generate a Shared SSH Key

1. Generate a new SSH key pair on a secure machine:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f shared_key
    ```

   This command will create two files: `shared_key` (private key) and `shared_key.pub` (public key).

### Step 2: Distribute the Public Key

1. Share the content of the `shared_key.pub` file with all team members.

### Step 3: Add the Shared Public Key to Servers

1. Append the content of `shared_key.pub` to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on each server:

    ```bash
    echo "ssh-rsa <shared_key_pub_content> shared_key" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

   Replace `<shared_key_pub_content>` with the actual content of the shared public key.

### Step 4: Set Permissions

1. Ensure proper permissions for the `~/.ssh` directory and the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:

    ```bash
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

### Step 5: Configure SSH on Clients

1. Team members configure their SSH client to use the shared private key by adding the following line to their `~/.ssh/config` file:

    ```
    Host *
      IdentityFile /path/to/shared_key
    ```

   Replace `/path/to/shared_key` with the actual path to the shared private key.

### Step 6: Test the Configuration

1. Team members should be able to SSH into the servers using the shared key:

    ```bash
    ssh username@server_ip
    ```

Again, while this approach is simpler, it may pose security risks, and it's generally advisable to use individual keys for each user to better manage and control access. If security and individual accountability are important, consider the key-per-user approach outlined in the previous response.
