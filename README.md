Sure, the process of generating an SSH key and setting up passwordless login between a Windows machine and an Ubuntu server. We'll use the OpenSSH tools, which are available for both Windows and Linux.

### Step 1: Install OpenSSH on Windows

1. **Enable OpenSSH Feature:**
   - Open the Settings app on your Windows machine.
   - Go to "Apps" > "Optional Features."
   - Scroll down and find "OpenSSH Client" and "OpenSSH Server."
   - Install both features.

### Step 2: Generate SSH Key Pair on Windows

1. **Open PowerShell:**
   - Open PowerShell on your Windows machine.

2. **Generate SSH Key Pair:**
   - Run the following command to generate an SSH key pair:
     ```powershell
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to specify the key file location (press Enter to use the default) and set a passphrase if desired.

### Step 3: Copy Public Key to Ubuntu Server

1. **Retrieve the Public Key:**
   - The public key is usually located in the `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub` file.

2. **Copy Public Key to Ubuntu Server:**
   - You can use a tool like `ssh-copy-id` or manually copy the public key content.
   - If using `ssh-copy-id`:
     ```powershell
     ssh-copy-id user@ubuntu-server-ip
     ```
     Replace `user` with your Ubuntu server username and `ubuntu-server-ip` with the actual IP address.

### Step 4: Configure Passwordless Login

1. **Test SSH Login:**
   - After copying the public key, try logging in to your Ubuntu server using SSH:
     ```powershell
     ssh user@ubuntu-server-ip
     ```
   - You should be prompted for the passphrase you set earlier. After entering it, you should log in without entering a password.

2. **Disable Password Authentication (Optional but recommended):**
   - To enhance security, you can disable password authentication and only allow key-based authentication on the Ubuntu server.
     - Open the SSH configuration file on the server:
       ```bash
       sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       ```
     - Set or ensure the following settings:
       ```conf
       PasswordAuthentication no
       ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
       UsePAM no
       ```
     - Save and close the file.
     - Restart the SSH service:
       ```bash
       sudo service ssh restart
       ```

That's it! You've successfully set up passwordless SSH login from your Windows machine to your Ubuntu server. Now, you should be able to SSH into your server without entering a password.
