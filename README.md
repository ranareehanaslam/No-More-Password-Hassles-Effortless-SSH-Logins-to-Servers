# SSH Key Generation and Passwordless Login Guide

This guide walks you through the process of generating an SSH key and setting up passwordless login between a Windows machine and an Ubuntu server using OpenSSH tools, available for both Windows and Linux.

## Step 1: Install OpenSSH on Windows

1. **Enable OpenSSH Feature:**
   - Open the Settings app on your Windows machine.
   - Navigate to "Apps" > "Optional Features."
   - Find and install "OpenSSH Client" and "OpenSSH Server."

## Step 2: Generate SSH Key Pair on Windows

1. **Open PowerShell:**
   - Launch PowerShell on your Windows machine.

2. **Generate SSH Key Pair:**
   - Run the following command to generate an SSH key pair:
     ```powershell
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to specify the key file location (press Enter to use the default) and set a passphrase if desired.

I've included the missing step for generating the SSH key on Windows using `ssh-keygen`. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

## Server Configuration (If needed):

1. **Create SSH Directory and File:**
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /root/.ssh
   sudo chmod 700 /root/.ssh
   sudo touch /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
   sudo chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

2. **Copy Public Key to Server:**
   ```powershell
   type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh root@your_server_ip "cat >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys"
   ```

## Step 3: Copy Public Key to Ubuntu Server

1. **Retrieve the Public Key:**
   - Locate the public key in `%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub`.

2. **Copy Public Key to Ubuntu Server:**
   - Run the following command to copy an SSH key pair:
     ```powershell
     type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh user@your_server_ip "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
     ```
   - Follow prompts to set the key file location and passphrase

## Step 4: Configure Passwordless Login

1. **Test SSH Login:**
   - Try logging in to your Ubuntu server:
     ```powershell
     ssh user@ubuntu-server-ip
     ```

2. **Optional: Disable Password Authentication**
   - Enhance security by disabling password authentication:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     # Set or ensure PasswordAuthentication, ChallengeResponseAuthentication, and UsePAM are set to 'no'.
     sudo service ssh restart
     ```

You've successfully established passwordless SSH login from your Windows machine to your Ubuntu server. Enjoy logging in without entering a password!
